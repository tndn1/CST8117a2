                    This is a gallery based in Ottawa Ontario.
                We are passionate about images that really touch the heart and ignite childhood imagination
                We believe that art isn't simply aesthetic purposes but spiritual purposes as well.
                The art we have here are lifechanging and are akin to a spiritual experience.
                The creator of the website is a prolific developer that trains hard much like this person on the left here.
                Sometimes, when he is coding, flames come out of his head and he uses the energy from that to power his home and therefore his laptop.
                Scientist have discovered that this method of energy generation might be the most energy efficient method of energy generation.
                You can't go wrong with a flaming bald head like the man in the photo.
